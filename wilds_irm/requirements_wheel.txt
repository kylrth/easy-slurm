# These are the packages not available on the cluster, which will be downloaded as wheels by
# setup.sh. When you want to add a new dependency or set of them, cd into the wheel directory and
# `pip download [dep] [dep] ...`, making sure to record here the exact package versions downloaded.
# This will help others reconstruct your project on their systems. If you notice that one of the
# downloaded wheels came from the DRAC wheelhouse, you can add it to requirements_slurm.txt instead
# and delete the wheel.
#
# It can also be good practice to specify the versions of transitive dependencies (dependencies of
# your dependencies), as I've done here, so that the exact same versions are used even in the future
# when these transitive dependencies are updated.
